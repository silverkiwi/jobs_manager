def process_delivery_receipt(purchase_order_id: str, line_allocations: dict) -> bool:
    """
    Process a delivery receipt for a purchase order based on detailed line allocations.

    This function:
    1. Validates the submitted allocation data for each PO line.
    2. Updates the received quantity on each PurchaseOrderLine.
    3. Deletes any previous Stock entries originating from these PO lines for this PO.
    4. Creates new Stock entries based on the provided allocations (linking to target jobs or stock holding job).
    5. Updates the overall PurchaseOrder status.

    Args:
        purchase_order_id: The ID of the purchase order being received.
        line_allocations: A dictionary where keys are PurchaseOrderLine IDs (str)
                          and values are dicts containing:
                          {
                              "total_received": float | str,
                              "allocations": [

                              ]
                          }

    Returns:
        bool: True if successful.

    Raises:
        DeliveryReceiptValidationError: If validation fails (e.g., allocation mismatch, invalid job ID).
        PurchaseOrder.DoesNotExist: If the purchase_order_id is invalid.
        PurchaseOrderLine.DoesNotExist: If a line_id in the input is invalid.
        Job.DoesNotExist: If a job_id in the allocations is invalid.
        Exception: For other unexpected errors during processing.
