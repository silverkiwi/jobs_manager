/*
 * File Overview:
 * ----------------
 * This file manages the creation and interaction of grids using AG Grid. It includes
 * functionality for dynamically initializing multiple grids (time, materials, adjustments)
 * across various sections (e.g., estimate, quote, reality), and includes a special revenue grid.
 * Later we might add cost with the revenue grid.
 *
 * Key Interactions:
 * - Autosave Integration:
 *   The autosave functionality depends on grid changes triggering an event that captures
 *   the data across all relevant grids. It is crucial that the APIs for each grid are correctly
 *   initialized and stored in `window.grids` to ensure autosave has access to the necessary data.
 *
 * - AG Grid API Storage:
 *   Each grid API is stored in `window.grids` once the grid is initialized. This is critical
 *   for autosave, `calculateTotalRevenue()`, and other inter-grid operations. The revenue grid is
 *   also included here, as it is required for proper calculation and data refresh.
 *
 * - AG Grid Version Compatibility:
 *   Ensure that changes align with AG Grid version 32.2.1. Be aware of deprecated properties
 *   and avoid using older APIs that may not be compatible with this version.
 *
 * Important Notes:
 * - The `onGridReady` function, inherited from `commonGridOptions`, is responsible for storing
 *   each grid's API in `window.grids`. Do not modify the initialization logic to exclude this step.
 * - Each grid API is crucial for the autosave mechanism. Breaking or missing the correct API
 *   initialization may lead to unexpected errors or the autosave failing silently.
 * - Maintain a consistent approach to API storage and avoid changes that bypass or duplicate
 *   API handling in `onGridReady`.
