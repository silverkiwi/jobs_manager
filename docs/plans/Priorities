Priorities:
    1. Able to parse supplier price PDFs
    2. Able to parse supplier quotes and create POs.  Use the generic PDF to text approach as per price lists
    3. Scraper is running correctly
    4. Logger on error sends an email
    5. MCP: Able to query supplier prices and stock
    6. Write a new schedule for refreshing prices in the scraper.  Regularly ordered products should be refreshed.  E.g. whenever the MCP server returns a product, add it to a products to refresh.
    7. Get a mistral API key
    8. Quote Report: quoting: quote accuracy, quote acceptance rate, etc., 
    9. Xero Reconciliation report: sales in app vs xero, and costs in app vs xero
